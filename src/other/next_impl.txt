In this file will be shown the different upgrades that can be added in the
future, with a order of preference or urgency.

1) Implementation of the board as a estruct with the next fields:
   - int* board   -> game board
   - player* p1   -> player 1
   - player* p1   -> player 2

2) Implementation of a player as a struct with the next fields:
   - int id
   - char pl_rep  -> player 1 representation (x, o,...)

3) Better AI: Currently theres a very poor evaluation of the game
   and heuristic, so the AI makes stupid errors.

4) Player chooser: Currently the player 1 can only be a human, and 
   the player 2 can be a human or the AI. A upgrade could be letting
   the user choose its own player.

5) More info at the display: When the current state of the board is 
   displayed at the console, the only info that is shown is the board 
   representation. 
   A good idea could be showing more info, such as the players IDs,
   their representation ('x', 'o', ...) and status (choosing, waiting).
