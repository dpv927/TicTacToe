In this file, the different upgrades that can be added in the future will be shown, with an order of preference or urgency.

    1) Implementation of the board as a struct with the following fields:
        int* board -> game board
        player* p1 -> player 1
        player* p2 -> player 2

    2) Implementation of a player as a struct with the following fields:
        int asker* (int*, Player)
        char pl_rep -> player representation ('x', 'o',...)

    3) Implementation of a enum that tells the actual status of the game
    instead of raw constants.

    3) Substitution of some of the basic game constants that are currently
    defined as numbers (unnecessary) with Enumerations.

    4) Better AI: Currently, there's a very poor evaluation of the game
    and heuristic, so the AI makes stupid errors.

    5) Player chooser: Currently, player 1 can only be a human, and
    player 2 can be a human or the AI. An upgrade could be letting
    the user choose their own player.

    6) More info at the display: When the current state of the board is
    displayed on the console, the only info shown is the board
    representation. A good idea could be showing more info, such as the
    players' IDs, their representation ('x', 'o', ...), and status 
    (choosing, waiting).
