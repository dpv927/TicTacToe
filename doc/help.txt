Usage: ttt <option> ... <option>

Options/Parameters:
  --versus                Create a 1vs1 match. The type of the players
                          can be selected with the '--p1-type' and
                          '--p2-type' arguments.

  --p1-type <type>        Specifies the player type for 'player1'. There 
                          are two possible values: "Human" and "Ai". The
                          Human type is controlled by the user, but the
                          Ai type is controlled by the user's machine.

  --p2-type <type>        Same as argument "--p1-type" but applied to 
                          player2.

  --depth-Ai1 [0..9]      In case player1 is of type Ai, the depth of the
                          search tree will be limited to the one set,
                          the minimum being 0 and the maximum 9. Keep 
                          in mind that the lower this parameter is, the
                          worse the search will result in worse movements.

  --depth-Ai1 [0..9]      Same as argument "--depth-Ai1" but applied to 
                          player2.

  --bestmove <state>      Search for the best move from a given state of 
                          a game board, which also indicates what player
                          has to move next. An example of a game state
                          is "201020101 2", in which player2 has the 
                          turn, and the characters '2' and '1' represent
                          the players' positions on the board. The board
                          positions are numbered from left to right and
                          from top to bottom.      
  
  --search-depth [0..9]   In case you use the '--bestmove' parameter, you
                          can indicate the depth of the search tree, 
                          limited to the one set, the minimum being 0
                          and the maximum 9.
