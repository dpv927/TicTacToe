Usage: ttt <option> ... <option>

Options/Parameters:
  --ai-mode                Play 1v1 with an AI. This command can be followed only by
                           the '--max-depth' command and a number after this last
                           command one. Example: "--ai-mode --max-depth 9" (Only in 
                           this specific order). The Ai's search depth in this case will
                           be the default (9 nodes = max).

  --player-mode            Play 1v1 with physical players. No more
                           parameters are available after this command.

  --max-depth <num>        Specify the maximum search depth for the AI. This can be
                           the third argument, being a number between 1 and 9.

  --version                Display ttt version information. No more
                           parameters are available after this command.

  --help                   Display this message. No more parammeters are 
                           available after this command.

  --search <state>         Search for the best move from a given state of a game board,
                           which also indicates what player has to move.



                                        --- EXAMPLES ---

ttt --ai-mode --depth 8    Play a 1vs1 game against the Ai. The Ai can search at a 
                           maximum depth of 8 nodes in the search tree.

ttt --search '1---122-- 1' Search for the best move at the given game state. The game state
                           string has two parts. The first describes the current moves over
                           the board, where each caracter defines the player that is allocated
                           in that cell of the board ('1' = player1, '2' = player2, and '-'
                           means that the cell is empty). 

                           This part describes each row of the board, from top to bottom and from 
                           left to right. If you didn't understand this last part, the board 
                           representation of '1---122-- 1' it's the following one:
                                                  
                                                      ┌───┬───┬───┐ 
                                                      │ x │   │   │ 
                                                      ├───┼───┼───┤
                                                      │   │ x │ o │
                                                      ├───┼───┼───┤
                                                      │ o │   │   │
                                                      └───┴───┴───┘
                            
                           The second part of the string, is separated by a space and tells what 
                           player has to move next. The search will look for the best move for 
                           this player with the default search depth (9 nodes = max).

ttt --search '2---211-- 2' --depth 6   Same as the last command, but this time we add the depth 
                                       option to limit the search at a specific node depth, such
                                       as you can do at the '--ai-mode --depth 8' command shown 
                                       before.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Every command must be typed in the shown order at this guide. Otherwise, ttt will
                  tell the user that the typed command is not valid.
